## üíª System Specs & Performance Notes

This project was developed and tested on a low-end laptop with:

- **GPU**: NVIDIA RTX 3050 (Laptop version)
- **CPU**: AMD Ryzen 5000 Series
- **VR App Warning**: The Meta Quest app reports this system as **not meeting the minimum requirements** for VR.

**Headset Settings**:

- **Refresh Rate**: 72 Hz
- **Rendering Resolution**: 3616 √ó 1856

Despite the hardware limitations, the scene ran **relatively smoothly** during testing. Performance is expected to **significantly improve** on higher-end systems with increased refresh rate and resolution.

## LSL Output

To monitor LSL (Lab Streaming Layer) output, run the following command in Windows Command Prompt or use your own methods:
`python -m pylsl.examples.ReceiveStringMarkers`

### Marker Values:

- **10**: Normal scene (`PostProcessingVolume.Unbound = False`)
- **11**: Weird scene (`PostProcessingVolume.Unbound = True`)
- **1‚Äì5**: Rating selected by the user

After going through **200 target points**, a CSV file will be automatically exported to: `C:/Users/Public/`

The file includes:

- Target Point Index
- User Rating (1‚Äì5)
- Post Processing Volume State (Unbound or not)
- Sun Angle
